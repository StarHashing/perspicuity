 * <p>SAF offers no atomic replace for a bare document URI — the app holds only
 * a single-document grant (no parent tree), and {@code renameDocument} cannot
 * overwrite an existing name — so true filesystem rename-atomicity is
 * unreachable here. This emulates it at the application layer:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>back up the existing bytes BEFORE anything is truncated,</li>
 *   <li>truncate + write the new bytes, fsync, and verify the written length,</li>
 *   <li>on ANY failure, tell the provider to discard the partial write and
 *       restore the backup so the file is never left empty.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>All provider I/O is behind {@link DocumentIo}, so this algorithm is unit
 * tested without Android.
