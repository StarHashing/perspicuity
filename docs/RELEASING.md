# Building & releasing Perspicuity

Perspicuity is self-built for personal use; there is no public release channel.
Any APK you build should keep the application id `com.starhashing.perspicuity`,
and if you ever do distribute one, always sign every build with the same
certificate so upgrades work cleanly.

## Key custody

- Keep the release keystore outside the repository.
- Keep its password and alias in a password manager.
- Maintain at least two encrypted, independently restorable keystore backups.
- Never print, commit, attach, or upload the raw keystore except as an encrypted
  GitHub Actions secret.

Official release certificate SHA-256:

```text
6E:C9:22:52:5B:CE:18:03:42:8B:80:F0:E2:57:7D:18:24:6B:22:90:B4:F3:BB:16:15:0F:A7:07:D1:81:9C:67
```

The release workflow rejects APKs signed by any other certificate.

## Repository secrets

Configure these in GitHub repository settings under Actions secrets:

```text
ANDROID_RELEASE_KEYSTORE_BASE64
ANDROID_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD
ANDROID_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS
ANDROID_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD
```

On Windows, copy the keystore's Base64 form without printing it:

```powershell
[Convert]::ToBase64String(
  [IO.File]::ReadAllBytes('E:\marktext-signing\marktext-release.jks')
) | Set-Clipboard
```

Use `marktext-release` for the alias. The store and key password may be the same
high-entropy password. Clear the clipboard after each secret is entered.

## Release sequence

1. Increment Android `versionCode`.
2. Set the same semantic version in `android/app/build.gradle`, `package.json`,
   and `src/lib/appInfo.ts`.
3. Merge the release candidate after normal pull-request checks pass.
4. Run the Android Release workflow manually to obtain a signed candidate APK.
5. Verify clean install and same-key upgrade on devices without losing app data.
6. Create and push the matching tag, for example `v0.1.0`.
7. The tag workflow verifies the version, signature, and certificate, then
   creates a draft GitHub Release containing the APK and SHA-256 checksum.
8. Inspect the draft notes and assets, then publish the Release manually.

## v0.2.1 release record

`v0.2.1` was published on August 13, 2026 (UTC) from commit `42335a4`. The tag
workflow produced `marktext-android-v0.2.1.apk` and its SHA-256 file. The
published APK:

- is 8,086,250 bytes;
- has SHA-256 `63b58fc99a486f10f6f7402aadde7f78f4795e5061d0c8a4a45ef164c032e191`;
- passed APK Signature Scheme v2 and the pinned release-certificate check; and
- passed a same-key upgrade over an installed v0.2.0 (versionCode 2 → 3) on an
  API 35 emulator, retaining a pre-existing local draft and opening it in the
  editor after the upgrade.

## v0.2.0 release record

`v0.2.0` was published on August 7, 2026 (UTC) from commit `1c89555`. The tag
workflow produced `marktext-android-v0.2.0.apk` and its SHA-256 file. The
published APK:

- is 8,082,926 bytes;
- has SHA-256 `fcbb19856cd762a22e97dc1db4f921ef84a80e7128ea32f4b0c2de828acb0ccf`;
- passed the pinned release-certificate verification in the tag workflow; and
- passed same-key upgrade over an installed v0.1.0 (versionCode 1 → 2) with
  draft retention, About-version, update-checker, and save-as flow checks on
  an API 35 emulator using the release-signed candidate APK.

Deliberately deferred to post-release testing: the release-client Google
Drive sign-in and a physical-device pass (the owner chose to publish first
and verify the real in-app update path — About → Check updates — on the
v0.1.0 phone install). API 24 runtime coverage remains outstanding as below.

## First release record

`v0.1.0` was published on July 15, 2026 from commit `0cca3ed`. The tag workflow
produced `marktext-android-v0.1.0.apk` and its SHA-256 file. The published APK:

- is 7,849,488 bytes;
- has SHA-256 `E506604D62377DD448FBA67F0B60F0CE110BC9A27FDFA60D47686953A141E2EB`;
- passed APK Signature Scheme v2 and release-certificate verification; and
- passed clean install, same-key replacement, cold launch, and draft-retention
  checks on an Android 14 physical device.

Runtime coverage at the declared minimum API 24 was not completed for this
release and remains part of the compatibility matrix for future updates.

The in-app update checker reads GitHub's latest published release. APK
installation remains an Android user-confirmed action. AAB delivery is deferred
until Google Play is selected as a distribution channel.
